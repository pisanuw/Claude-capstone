# Config-driven deploy

Edit one file, push, and GitHub Actions provisions and deploys the app to the
host you chose. No secrets live in the repo: the provider tokens are GitHub repo
secrets injected into the workflow at run time, and the assistant editing
`target.yml` never sees them.

## How it works

```
deploy/target.yml          <- the control file you (or the assistant) edit
deploy/deploy.mjs          <- reads the control file, calls the provider
deploy/deploy.workflow.yml <- the GitHub Actions workflow (copy to repo root)
```

1. `target.yml` says which provider (`render` or `netlify`), the project name,
   the app directory, the build command, and which env var **names** to forward.
2. On push to `target.yml` (or a manual run), the workflow runs
   `node accessibility-lens/deploy/deploy.mjs` from the repo root.
3. The runner creates the project if it does not exist, then deploys. It is
   idempotent: re-running deploys to the same project instead of duplicating it.

## One-time setup

1. **Add repo secrets** in GitHub: Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions.
   - `RENDER_API_KEY` (only for `provider: render`)
   - `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` (only for `provider: netlify`)
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (optional; forwarded to the app)
2. **Install the workflow.** Copy `deploy/deploy.workflow.yml` to
   `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` at the repository root and commit it. (This
   step needs the GitHub `workflow` token scope, which is why the file ships
   here rather than pre-installed.)

## Daily use

Change `provider`, `projectName`, or any setting in `target.yml`, commit, and
push. The workflow does the rest. To deploy without changing the file, trigger
"Deploy (config-driven)" manually from the Actions tab.

## Try it safely first

The runner has a dry-run mode that prints exactly what it would do and makes no
API calls:

```bash
cd accessibility-lens/deploy
npm install
node deploy.mjs --dry-run                       # uses target.yml
node deploy.mjs --dry-run --config target.yml    # explicit
```

## Provider notes

**Render.** Uses the Render REST API. Creates a `web_service` from this repo with
`autoDeploy` on, so subsequent pushes also redeploy via Render's own git
integration. The runner resolves your workspace automatically; set
`render.ownerId` to pin it. Render runs the build itself, server-side.

**Netlify.** Uses the Netlify CLI. Because this app is not static (it has a
server-side API), the deploy publishes `client/dist` to the CDN and ships the API
as a serverless function (`netlify/functions/api.mjs`), wired up by
`netlify.toml`. The runner builds locally, then uploads.

For the simplest Netlify "automagic" path you can instead connect the repo in the
Netlify UI and set the base directory to `accessibility-lens`; Netlify then reads
`netlify.toml` and autodeploys on every push with no workflow at all.

## Security

- Tokens are never written to `target.yml` or any committed file. Only env var
  **names** appear in config; values come from secrets at run time.
- The derived repo URL is stripped of any embedded credentials before use.
- Treat anyone with push access as able to trigger a deploy; scope the provider
  tokens to the minimum needed.
