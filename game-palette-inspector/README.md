# Game Palette Inspector

Check a game palette against WCAG contrast and 8 types of color vision deficiency, then get replacement colors that keep your art style. Roughly 8% of male players (and about 0.5% of female players) have some form of color vision deficiency; most game color tooling ignores them.

Everything runs in the browser. No accounts, no uploads, no API keys, no tracking.

## What it does

- **Bench**: build a palette by hand (hex or color picker), load a preset, or drop a game screenshot. Screenshots have their 8 dominant colors extracted automatically. Mark one color as the background.
- **Vision lab**: a contact sheet of the palette through eight vision types (protanomaly, protanopia, deuteranomaly, deuteranopia, tritanomaly, tritanopia, achromatomaly, achromatopsia). With a screenshot loaded, the whole frame is simulated too.
- **Contrast**: a WCAG contrast-ratio matrix for every color pair, with a selectable target (3:1 UI/large text, 4.5:1 AA text, 7:1 AAA text) and explicit pass/fail marks.
- **Confusion report**: pairs that are clearly distinct with typical vision but collapse under a specific deficiency, measured perceptually in OKLab, with the worst-case vision type named.
- **Fix studio**: one-click replacements that reach the contrast target against the background by shifting only OKLCH lightness, so hue (your art direction) is preserved. The tool is honest about impossibility: 7:1 is unreachable against worst-case mid-tone backgrounds, and it says so instead of inventing a color.
- **Export**: PNG report (canvas rendered), print-to-PDF (light, ink-friendly stylesheet), and shareable URLs (the palette lives in the location hash).

## Quick start

Run these from this directory (`game-palette-inspector/`), not the repo root.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # local dev server
npm test          # color-engine unit tests (node --test, no framework)
npm run build     # production build in dist/
```

## Deployment

This app was moved into the `Claude-capstone` monorepo on 2026-08-27 from the
standalone `pisanuw/c1` repo, and now deploys the same way as every other package
here: the repo-level `Deploy` workflow discovers [`deploy/target.yml`](./deploy/target.yml)
and pushes a build to Netlify with the CLI. The Netlify site id is pinned in that
file and is the same site the old repo published to, so
<https://game-palette-inspector.netlify.app> is unchanged.

The old repo's two deploy paths are gone: Netlify no longer builds from
`pisanuw/c1` (that git connection was removed to stop it fighting with this
workflow), and the GitHub Pages mirror at `pisanuw.github.io/c1` now redirects
here rather than serving its own copy. Vite's `base: './'` is still set, so the
build works at any subpath.

## Methodology

- **Contrast**: WCAG 2.x relative luminance and contrast ratio.
- **CVD simulation**: Machado, Oliveira and Fernandes (2009), "A Physiologically-based Model for Simulation of Color Vision Deficiency", IEEE TVCG 15(6). Matrices applied in linear sRGB (severity 0.6 for the anomalous forms, 1.0 for dichromacy), verified against the colour-science reference dataset. Achromatopsia is Rec. 709 luminance gray; achromatomaly is a 50% blend toward it.
- **Perceptual distance**: Euclidean in OKLab (Ottosson 2020), where black to white is 1.00. Pairs under 0.10 are flagged as confusable, under 0.04 as near identical.
- **Fixes**: binary search over OKLCH lightness with chroma clamped to the sRGB gamut at each step, keeping hue fixed.

Simulations are good approximations, not ground truth; individual perception varies. The interface follows its own advice: the accent is a protan/deutan-safe cyan and no pass/fail state is carried by color alone.

## Stack

React 18 + Vite. Zero runtime dependencies beyond React; all color math is hand-rolled in `src/color/` and unit tested.
