2026-06-10 [note] Initialized. Two projects shipped: accessibility-lens (WCAG analyzer) and mult-streak/mult-streak-edge (multiplication game on Render + Netlify).
2026-06-10 [code] security(F1): mult-streak + mult-streak-edge config.ts now throws at boot when COOKIE_SECRET missing in production; insecure fallback restricted to non-production only.
2026-06-10 [code] security(F3): accessibility-lens fetchPage.ts: replace redirect:follow with manual hop-by-hop redirect following; each Location URL re-validated by assertSafeUrl; added 100.64.0.0/10 block.
2026-06-10 [code] test: added config.test.ts for mult-streak + mult-streak-edge; 6 redirect/CGN-range tests added to accessibility-lens fetchPage.test.ts; all test suites green.
2026-06-10 [code] ci: rewrote ci.yml - removed stale "move this file" comment, added jobs for mult-streak and mult-streak-edge (were uncovered), no path filters.
2026-06-10 [code] ci: added eslint + typescript-eslint + globals to mult-streak and mult-streak-edge devDeps; created eslint.config.js for each; removed stale eslint-disable in store.ts.
2026-06-10 [doc] ci: added CI badge to README.md.
2026-06-10 [decision] history: adopt Conventional Commits going forward; commit-msg hook added in .git-hooks/commit-msg; git core.hooksPath set.
2026-06-10 [doc] readme: fixed test counts (102→107 accessibility-lens, 34→42 mult-streak/edge); removed stale "activate CI" note; added live URL for accessibility-lens.
2026-06-10 [doc] metadata: added root LICENSE (MIT); set GitHub repo description and 8 topics; created CLAUDE.md with commit convention and project overview.

2026-06-10 [code] security: hardened assertSafeUrl to block IPv6 ULA/link-local (fc00::/7, fe80::/10), IPv4-mapped IPv6 (::ffff:*), and decimal IPv4 encodings; fixed pre-existing [::1] bypass (Node.js URL parser keeps brackets); added 5 new tests.
2026-06-10 [code] security: added schema version field (v:1) to GameState in mult-streak and mult-streak-edge; decodeState rejects cookies where v !== 1, degrading old cookies gracefully; added 3 version tests per package.

2026-06-12 [feat] mult-streak + mult-streak-edge: added factoring mode (factor composites 1000-1000000 into prime factorization). Mode selector shown at streak=0; cookie schema bumped to v:2. 77 tests each, 97.87% coverage.

2026-08-20 [code] schema-storyteller: pinned netlify siteId + accountSlug in deploy/target.yml so deploy skips the create-site fallback once NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN is rotated.

2026-08-20 [code] migration-diff-narrator: new package (idea 2026-08-17 n1). Rule-based schema diff for SQL DDL + TS interfaces, 74 vitest tests, 97% stmt coverage; deterministic severity rules replace the suggested Claude API calls.

2026-08-20 [code] shortcut-sprint: new package (idea 2026-08-13 n1). SM-2 shortcut trainer for VS Code/DevTools/Figma/Vim + custom JSON sets, 78 vitest tests, 98.6% stmt coverage; localStorage replaces the suggested Supabase backend.

2026-08-20 [code] ci: deploy workflow now deploys only the target.ymls changed in the push; full redeploy on manual dispatch, runner/workflow changes, or uncomputable diffs.
2026-08-20 [code] ci: shortcut-sprint source changes now select its deployment target so bundled shortcut updates reach Netlify.

2026-08-21 [code] ui-diff-lens: new package (idea 2026-08-16 n1). Classified screenshot diff: YIQ pixel diff + AA detection, clustering, 7-type heuristic classifier; 56 vitest tests, 96.4% stmt coverage.
2026-08-21 [decision] ui-diff-lens: replaced the idea's Claude Vision classification with deterministic heuristics (displacement search, opacity fit, edge correlation); free, offline, private.

2026-08-21 [code] code-review-gauntlet: new package (idea 2026-08-11 n1). Timed bug-spotting game: seeded mutation engine, 11 templates/51 defects, daily challenge, skill radar; 46 vitest tests, 99.8% stmt coverage.
2026-08-21 [decision] code-review-gauntlet: replaced the idea's Claude puzzle generation with a seeded single-line mutation engine and the Supabase leaderboard with a date-seeded daily + localStorage profile.

2026-08-21 [code] sound-sketchpad: new package (idea 2026-08-09 n1). Text-to-sound-effect synthesizer: word-to-DSP lexicon (20 bases, 18 modifiers), pure sample renderer, WAV export; 59 vitest tests, 100% stmt coverage.
2026-08-21 [decision] sound-sketchpad: replaced the idea's Claude API code generation with a deterministic keyword lexicon + seeded DSP engine; same words always yield the same sound, free and offline.

2026-08-21 [code] sql-replay: new package (idea 2026-07-30 n1). Step-by-step SQL SELECT replay: tokenizer/parser/3VL evaluator/staged executor emitting a narrated Step trace; 86 vitest tests, 99.7% stmt coverage.
2026-08-21 [decision] sql-replay: replaced the idea's optional Claude narrator with deterministic per-stage narration generated from execution stats, and Framer Motion with CSS animations; zero runtime deps.

2026-08-23 [code] har-detective: new package (idea 2026-08-21 n1). Client-side HAR analyzer: forgiving parser, 10 deterministic detectors, SVG waterfall, Markdown report; 56 vitest tests, 100% stmt coverage.
2026-08-23 [decision] har-detective: replaced the idea's Claude API analysis with hand-written rule detectors (N+1, caching, compression, redirects, serialized calls, duplicates, errors, TTFB, payload size, HTTP/1.x churn); the HAR never leaves the browser.

2026-08-25 [code] code-analogy-forge: new package (idea 2026-08-25 n1). Audience-calibrated CS analogies: 14 concepts x 3 domains x 4 audiences (168 hand-written texts), keyword + code-shape detector with body-scoped self-call analysis, localStorage library, serverless share links, Markdown export; 61 vitest tests, 99.8% stmt coverage.
2026-08-25 [decision] code-analogy-forge: replaced the idea's Claude API generation with a curated deterministic corpus and Supabase with localStorage + hash-encoded read-only share links; free, offline, reproducible, honest "not detected" outside its 14 concepts.
2026-08-25 [code] code-analogy-forge: fixed audience toggle highlight not moving on click (aria-pressed was set only at creation); verified in headless Chromium, redeployed.
2026-08-25 [code] code-analogy-forge: example button replaced by a 10-example menu (one per concept family, test-pinned to rank its intended concept first); 'function' keyword no longer fires on JS syntax; 74 vitest tests.
2026-08-25 [code] ci: code-analogy-forge source changes now select its deployment target, same as shortcut-sprint.

2026-08-25 [code] code-analogy-forge: corpus grown 14 -> 25 concepts (closures, pointers/references, exceptions, caching, threads/parallelism, Big-O, git, APIs, encryption, binary numbers, graphs): 132 new analogy texts, detector rules for each, examples menu now one per concept (25); 97 vitest tests, 99.9% stmt coverage.

2026-08-26 [code] code-analogy-forge: corpus grown 25 -> 47 concepts (linked lists, sets, heaps, hashing, state machines, boolean logic, scope, abstraction, regex, floating point, compilers, databases, HTTP, DNS, packets, events, debugging, testing, refactoring, GC, randomness, operating systems): 264 new texts, detector rules and a pinned example per concept, menus grouped into ten optgroups; 125 vitest tests, 99.9% stmt coverage.

2026-08-27 [scope] game-palette-inspector: moved in from standalone pisanuw/c1 via git subtree (history preserved). Netlify siteId pinned to the existing site, so the public URL is unchanged.
2026-08-27 [code] ci: added game-palette-inspector job (install/test/build only; app is plain JS with node --test, so no lint/typecheck/coverage scripts exist).
2026-08-27 [scope] pathfinding-playground: moved in from standalone pisanuw/pathfinding-playground via git subtree (history preserved). Netlify siteId pinned to the existing site, so the public URL is unchanged.
2026-08-27 [code] ci: added pathfinding-playground job (install/test/build only; plain JS with vitest, no lint/typecheck/coverage scripts).

2026-08-28 [code] type-witness: new package (idea 2026-08-02 n1). In-browser TypeScript inference visualizer: real compiler (pinned 5.6.3) in a Web Worker over an in-memory FS with the 57-file ES2022 lib closure bundled raw; post-order AST walk emits narrated steps (literals, widening, generic bindings via guarded internal signature.target/mapper, contextual params, narrowing, return inference) with diagnostics threaded in after the offending step; hover-type witness view, autoplay, major-step filter, URL-hash share links. 62 vitest tests, 97.6% stmt coverage.
2026-08-28 [decision] type-witness: the idea had no LLM to replace; kept it fully client-side by bundling the compiler + libs (~1 MB gzipped worker chunk, the one real cost) instead of any server. React swapped for the monorepo's vanilla TS + Vite house pattern.

2026-09-02 [code] cron-cartographer: new package (idea 2026-09-02 n1). Cron/RRULE/GitHub-Actions/plain-English schedule visualizer: calendar heatmap of every firing over 30/90/365 days, dual time-zone pickers backed by exact Intl offset-transition tables (DST gaps reported as skipped, fall-back ambiguity fires once at the earlier instant), plain-English descriptions, next-25 table, query-param share links. 74 vitest tests, 92% stmt coverage.
2026-09-02 [decision] cron-cartographer: replaced the idea's Claude API NL-to-cron with a deterministic rule set that annotates every assumption and returns null honestly, and replaced cronstrue/cron-parser with a hand-written engine; zero runtime dependencies.

2026-09-03 [code] summit-navigator: new package (idea 2026-09-03 n1). Mobile-first conference schedule browser for the ACM AI Leadership Summit: sticky day tabs, track chips, full-text search, localStorage starred agenda, timezone-aware now/next banner, single validated schedule.json. 42 vitest tests, >=85% thresholds.
2026-09-03 [code] ci: added emoji-lingua job (typecheck/coverage/build; package has no lint script).
2026-09-03 [doc] CLAUDE.md: added summit-navigator to the commit scope list.
2026-09-03 [scope] Removed DoProject.md (auto-pick-an-idea prompt); superseded by the weekly build routine, which receives the idea from Yusuf and records it in daily-project-ideas.

2026-09-23 [code] prompt-shrink-ray: new package (idea 2026-09-15 n1). Client-side LLM-prompt compressor: label/heuristic section decomposition, three-level rewrite pipeline (whitespace/filler, verbose-phrase simplification + cross-section duplicate-sentence removal, hedge removal + few-shot trimming), token/cost estimate, word-level LCS diff, and a keyword-retention check (numbers, quotes, inline/fenced code, proper nouns) that names anything dropped. 76 vitest tests, 100% stmt coverage.
2026-09-23 [decision] prompt-shrink-ray: replaced the idea's suggested Claude Haiku compression call and Claude Sonnet equivalence check with a deterministic rule set and a term-retention heuristic; fenced code is hidden behind a placeholder before any rule runs so it is never rewritten.
2026-09-23 [doc] CLAUDE.md: added prompt-shrink-ray to the commit scope list.

2026-09-25 [code] agent-blast-radius: new package (idea 2026-09-23 n1). Client-side scanner for MCP configs (Claude Desktop/Cursor/VS Code/Claude Code), Claude Code permission settings, and browser/VS Code extension manifests; scores filesystem/shell/network/credentials/browser reach with evidence, flags plaintext secrets and risky config. 95 vitest tests, >99% stmt coverage.
2026-09-25 [decision] agent-blast-radius: shipped as a static drop-in-files web app instead of the idea's local CLI, so it deploys to Netlify with zero install; unrecognized local MCP servers are scored as full-privilege code rather than as safe.
2026-09-25 [doc] CLAUDE.md: added agent-blast-radius to the commit scope list; ci: added agent-blast-radius job.

2026-09-28 [code] repo-weight-map: new package (idea 2026-09-28 n1). Browser-only folder walker (File System Access API, webkitdirectory, drag-and-drop), hand-written squarified treemap with zoom, 19 ecosystem-aware junk rules, .gitignore diff, HTML report. 40 vitest tests, 100% stmt coverage on core.
2026-09-28 [decision] repo-weight-map: git history mode (large blobs only in history, filter-repo command) left out; needs a packfile/delta reader and did not fit Weekend size. .git is counted in the treemap but never opened.
2026-09-28 [doc] CLAUDE.md: added repo-weight-map to the commit scope list; ci: added repo-weight-map job.

2026-09-28 [code] cipher-ladder: new package (idea 2026-09-25 n2).

2026-09-28 [decision] cipher-ladder: the idea's LLM debrief is a deterministic solver per cipher (chi-squared, IC/Kasiski, permutation search, trigram hill-climb, annealing) with a written step log; Supabase auth/rosters replaced by localStorage plus exported JSON.
2026-09-28 [doc] CLAUDE.md: added cipher-ladder to the commit scope list; ci: added cipher-ladder job.

2026-09-30 [code] where-does-it-say: new package (idea 2026-09-30 n1). Quote-or-refuse course Q&A: verified verbatim spans highlighted in a side-by-side viewer, quote checker with word diff, gap log/report. 91 vitest tests, 99.7% stmt coverage.
2026-09-30 [decision] where-does-it-say: the idea's Claude Haiku proposer is a deterministic BM25 sentence retriever (no API key or server); packs travel deflated in the URL fragment; logs are exported JSON, not a backend.
2026-09-30 [doc] CLAUDE.md: added where-does-it-say to the commit scope list; ci: added where-does-it-say job (Node 22, pdfjs-dist 6 needs it).

2026-10-01 [code] elevator-algorithm-lab: new package (idea 2026-09-29 n2). Student dispatch policies in a Web Worker, seeded scenarios, animated building, side-by-side compare, disk view. 53 vitest tests, 100% stmt coverage.
2026-10-01 [decision] elevator-algorithm-lab: cars stop only where the policy sends them (matches disk scheduling exactly); leaderboard is localStorage + CSV/JSON export, not Supabase; hidden scenarios travel in the share link.
2026-10-01 [doc] CLAUDE.md: added elevator-algorithm-lab to the commit scope list; ci: added elevator-algorithm-lab job.

2026-10-02 [code] reverse-minesweeper-studio: new package (idea 2026-09-29 n1). Mine painter, four-tier no-guess solver, amber stuck/sealed regions, A/B ambiguity layouts, single-edit fix search in a Web Worker, solver replay, URL-fragment play links. 40 vitest tests, 99.9% stmt coverage.
2026-10-02 [decision] reverse-minesweeper-studio: vanilla TS + canvas instead of React/Tailwind; "solved" means every safe cell opened (untouched interior mines need not be identified); frontier search capped at 250k nodes per pass.
2026-10-02 [doc] CLAUDE.md: added reverse-minesweeper-studio to the commit scope list; ci: added reverse-minesweeper-studio job.

2026-10-02 [code] state-space-atlas: new package (idea 2026-10-01 n2). Exhaustive state graphs (Hanoi, tiles, Klotski, Rush Hour) in a Web Worker, layered/radial canvas atlas, steppable BFS/DFS/IDDFS/greedy/A*, heuristic admissibility and consistency checker, challenge links. 65 vitest tests, 99.6% stmt coverage.
2026-10-02 [decision] state-space-atlas: canvas 2D instead of Sigma.js/regl; same-size block pieces and mirror images share one node; IDDFS is the graph variant (skip states reached at the same or smaller depth); all searches test the goal at expansion; state cap 400k.
2026-10-02 [doc] CLAUDE.md: added state-space-atlas to the commit scope list; ci: added state-space-atlas job.

2026-10-03 [code] bombe-bench: new package (idea 2026-10-03 n2). Enigma I with signal-path SVG, crib sliding, menu graph with cycle basis, Bombe search with loop prefilter and diagonal board in a Web Worker, checking machine, hypothesis tracer, challenge links. 55 vitest tests, 98.8% stmt coverage.
2026-10-03 [decision] bombe-bench: vanilla TS + SVG instead of React/Tailwind; loops through the test letter are checked as a fixed-point test before propagation (1M positions in about 1 s); stops report core positions at ring A; single-survivor menu components merge their plugs into the stop.
2026-10-03 [doc] CLAUDE.md: added bombe-bench to the commit scope list; ci: added bombe-bench job.

2026-10-06 [code] heap-arena-replay: new package (idea 2026-10-06 n2). Word-accurate CS:APP-style heap with implicit/explicit/segregated lists, first/next/best/worst fit, immediate/deferred/no coalescing, realloc, mid-replay policy switch, compare tab, simulator-verified quiz with QTI export, student trace diff, share links. 57 vitest tests, 99.1% stmt coverage.
2026-10-06 [decision] heap-arena-replay: vanilla TS + SVG instead of React/Tailwind/Recharts; fixed arena with no sbrk so a failed malloc returns NULL; next-fit only on the implicit list; free lists rebuilt in address order after a policy switch; QTI zip written by a dependency-free stored-zip writer.
2026-10-06 [doc] CLAUDE.md: added heap-arena-replay to the commit scope list; ci: added heap-arena-replay job.

2026-10-17 [code] shortcut-sprint: bundled Excel, Visio, Word, and Acrobat Reader sets (86 shortcuts, Mac bindings from Microsoft/Adobe docs); custom sets reusing a bundled id are hidden. 85 tests.
2026-10-17 [code] accessibility-lens, emoji-lingua: retired claude-sonnet-4-20250514 replaced by claude-sonnet-5-5 (low effort, max_tokens 1024); refusals fall back to the non-AI output.

2026-10-21 [code] code-viva: new package (idea 2026-10-21 n1). Zip/Classroom import, questions from student code and commits, timed link session, scored evidence, flag queue. 79 tests, 99.6% stmt.
2026-10-21 [decision] code-viva: templates and a keyword rubric replace Claude API; no Supabase/Flask (vivas in URL fragment, answers as response codes); mostly pasted replies earn no credit.
2026-10-21 [doc] CLAUDE.md: added code-viva to the commit scope list; ci: added code-viva job.

2026-10-21 [decision] deploy: only main deploys; a missing base diffs the tip commit, not deploy-all; editing deploy.yml alone deploys nothing. New daily workflow deletes merged claude/* branches.

2026-10-21 [code] code-viva: 10 more demo courses (C, C++, C#, Java, Python, JS, TS) in a picker at the top; How it works tab and per-step help; late/single-commit checks from 20 lines; siteId pinned.

2026-10-22 [code] diagram-layout-engine: new package (idea 2026-10-18 n3). Mermaid-subset parser, Sugiyama pipeline, routing, subgraphs, themes, diff, inspector, benchmark. 88 tests, 98.9% stmt.

2026-10-23 [note] assignment-stress-test: demo recorded with the claude CLI in a whitelisted env; Sonnet 5.5 rejected effort high via the CLI, so attempts retry once at default effort.
2026-10-23 [doc] CLAUDE.md: added assignment-stress-test to the commit scope list; ci: added assignment-stress-test job (installs pytest).
2026-10-23 [code] assignment-stress-test: deployed to assignment-stress-test.netlify.app; siteId pinned.

2026-10-24 [doc] CLAUDE.md: added cache-miss-theater to the commit scope list; ci: added cache-miss-theater job.

2026-10-24 [code] cache-miss-theater: deployed to cache-miss-theater.netlify.app; siteId pinned.

2026-10-25 [decision] edit-graph-lab: quadratic-space forward Myers so every step and the V array can be replayed; histogram uses a simplified rarest-then-longest rule; no git indent heuristic.

2026-10-25 [doc] CLAUDE.md: added edit-graph-lab to the commit scope list; ci: added edit-graph-lab job.

2026-10-25 [code] edit-graph-lab: deployed to edit-graph-lab.netlify.app; siteId pinned.

2026-10-26 [code] lockstep-lab: deployed to lockstep-lab.netlify.app; siteId pinned.

2026-10-27 [decision] tetromino-arcade: built on direct user request (not from the ideas list); named Tetromino Arcade to avoid using the Tetris trademark as a product name.

2026-10-27 [decision] tetromino-arcade: deterministic 60 fps core with seeded bag so replays are seed + key log; CPU uses El-Tetris weights over hard-drop placements, no LLM.

2026-10-27 [doc] CLAUDE.md: added tetromino-arcade to the commit scope list; ci: added tetromino-arcade job.

2026-10-27 [code] tetromino-arcade: deployed to tetromino-arcade.netlify.app; siteId pinned.

2026-10-27 [doc] CLAUDE.md: added net-units to the commit scope list; ci: added net-units job.

2026-10-27 [code] net-units: deployed to net-units.netlify.app; siteId pinned.

2026-10-27 [decision] study-buddy-matchmaker: deterministic mastery profiles and max-weight matching (exact DP up to 20 students) instead of Claude clustering; no backend, data stays in the browser.

2026-10-27 [code] study-buddy-matchmaker: deployed to study-buddy-matchmaker.netlify.app; siteId pinned.

2026-10-27 [decision] fork-count: pipes modelled with one writer and one reader per pipe and each write() delivered whole, so reads are schedule-independent; runner suspends and re-runs readers.

2026-10-27 [code] fork-count: added pipe/read/close/dup/dup2, int and char arrays, char * strings, exec filters (wc, sort, grep, tr, ...), deadlock detection, 24 pipe examples, a pipe quiz template.

2026-10-27 [fix] repo-weight-map: findings were gitignore-blind — a rule fired on disk presence, so an already-ignored node_modules/ read as "Committed node_modules" and its bytes landed in the "should not be in git" tile. Added src/core/ignore.ts, a real gitignore matcher (anchoring, **, ?, classes, ! last-match-wins, no descent into excluded dirs), cross-checked against git check-ignore on 27 paths / 17 pattern forms.
2026-10-27 [decision] repo-weight-map: findings now carry coverage none/partial/all from the root .gitignore; fully-covered ones stay visible badged "Already ignored" rather than disappearing, and the headline tile shows actionableBytes (flagged and not yet ignored) instead of all flagged bytes. Root .gitignore only: nested ignores, .git/info/exclude, global excludes and tracked-but-ignored files are out of a browser's reach and documented as such.

2026-10-28 [decision] pluck-lab: vanilla TS + AudioWorklet, one Engine class shared by worklet, ScriptProcessor fallback and tests; views run a seeded mirror of the watched string so they can slow down.

2026-10-28 [decision] pluck-lab: deterministic filter analysis (linearity, randomness, least-squares gain/phase per frequency, predicted T60) replaces the suggested Claude explanation; no backend.

2026-10-28 [doc] CLAUDE.md: added pluck-lab to the commit scope list; ci: added pluck-lab job.

2026-10-28 [code] pluck-lab: deployed to pluck-lab.netlify.app; siteId pinned.

2026-10-29 [decision] pull-the-pin: SAP-1 modules as idealized single chip packages; fault set = consistent-by-waveform-hash over a 3,810 single-fault catalog, computed in a Web Worker.

2026-10-29 [decision] pull-the-pin: deterministic best-next-probe (min expected remaining faults) replaces the suggested Claude hints; attempts kept in localStorage instead of Supabase.

2026-10-29 [doc] CLAUDE.md: added pull-the-pin to the commit scope list; ci: added pull-the-pin job.

2026-10-31 [code] brocot-gear-finder, type-witness: fixed sideways page scroll on phones (convergents table in .table-wrap; wrapping toolbar and step controls). Checked at 320/360/390px.
